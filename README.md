Exploration : Based on random action for 100 episodes.<br />
Training : <br />
- Training is done on explored data.<br />
- Reward function is defined as the number of time steps survived.<br />
	Q = reward_for_current_step + Max_Qvalue_for_next_step<br /><br />
- It is trained based on actor critic algorithm. 
-- The critic network models the Q value and the actor network tries to maximize the reward for all possible states that has been explored <br />
Activation function used : Elu<br />
Regularization : Droupout<br />
Optimizer : Adam<br />
Network : Actor(State>10>10>2-Action), Critic(State+Action>10>10>1-Qvalue)<br />
Normalization : layer normalization<br />
<br />
Result during training 20 episodes based on explored data<br />
